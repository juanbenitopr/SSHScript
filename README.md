It is a simple script where you can specify your hosts, username and pass and sending commands to different hosts.

First argument, hosts (separated by space), I am working for reading the hosts from a txt, and you can specify some specific format for usename and password
Second argument username
Third argument password
Fourth argument command to execute


example:
  ssh_script_file.py "host1 host2" username password "command"
